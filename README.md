# Machine Learning
> Understanding **different techniques** with sample examples

## Overview
Over the *last decade*, we learnt *analytic techniques* to greater extent, and are able to *gain strategical decisions* help gaining the *business to run in next level*. Paradigm is now shifting towords *heuristics* and *predictions*, leveraging our analytic skills. 

Additionally, we are moving towards making *machines more intelligent*. With that, we now have capabilities to, *train the machines*, to understand data & respective models/trends, and hence to be able to *run different techniques* to get *consumable insight/information*. The above all mentioned stuff comes under Machine Learning scope. 

Machine Learning subject seems to be little tricky, but is very interesting for those who enjoy doing data manipulation. To start with this, one needs to have some subject level understanding beforehand, which mainly includes, *understanding of data*, concepts of *statistics*, and hands-on in programming languages like *python* or *matlab* etc.

I have started as a beginner in this field, and are in ramp-up mode currently. I am utilizing my *knowledge on Bigdata*, and *skills on relevent programming aspects*. My prior *experience with pharma-data* would probably help me in getting the things done easily. 

Though, I took programs from one of the references mentioned below, I have put genuine effort in understanding the concepts and added useful comments/logs. Programs would definitly *help a naive programmer* or *students* in catching up things faster. and more interstingly to have an *initial hands-on* to this new world of *Machine Learning*.

## Usage
Programs are mainly written using *python's numpy*, *math* and other related libraries. 

Programs are *named in such a way*, to give *intuitive understanding* about the used techniques. Additionally, *README*  file is supplied for any specific set of commands.

## Conclusion
Since, programs are written specifically for basic understanding of concepts and techniques, hence are not claimed for any performance benchmarking exercises.
